# Dining Philosophers Simulation

## Overview
This Python project simulates the classic Dining Philosophers problem, a thought experiment in concurrency and computer science that demonstrates potential challenges in resource management and synchronization.

## Problem Description
The Dining Philosophers problem is a classic synchronization problem that illustrates the challenges of resource sharing and avoiding deadlock in a multi-process environment.

## Dining_Philosophers
This is a Python implementation of the Dining Philosophers problem with a visual representation using matplotlib.
Resource hierarchy perspective was used in its solution.

## Features
Thread-based implementation: Represents philosophers as threads and forks as locks to simulate concurrent actions.
Deadlock prevention: Employs a priority-based approach to avoid deadlocks by assigning priorities to forks.
Visualization: Includes both a text-based table view and an animated Matplotlib visualization for real-time observation of the simulation.
Customizable parameters: Allows adjustment of the number of philosophers and their initial spaghetti portions for experimentation.
